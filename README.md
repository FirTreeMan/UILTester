This is a Java Swing application designed to simulate the [University Interscholastic League Computer Science](https://www.uiltexas.org/academics/stem/computer-science) competition's programming section. 

Currently, there are resources for finding past questions, but no software yet exists that allows participants to solve these questions in a realistic competition environment. This software aims to remedy this issue by giving participants a convenient way to practice UIL CS exams. With this software, users may solve previous UIL CS programming competitions with the same constraints as in an in-person competition (i.e. solve "virtual contests") to better practice for UIL.

Note that you will need the [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) to use this software.

To run, execute `UILTester.jar`.

PS: This is a work-in-progress. Competition data from previous years is still being added to the repository :)
