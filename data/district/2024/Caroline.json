  "Body": "Caroline's teacher in her AP Psychology class told her that if someone is asked to select a random number, it is more likely that\nthe number will be an even number. Her class ran an experiment to verify this, and they discovered it was true.\n\nShe got to thinking. What if ten people selected a random number, would the sum of the even numbers be greater than the sum\nof the odds?\n\nSo, she has asked you to write a program to answer that question. Your job is to read in a list of ten whole numbers. Find the\nsum of the odd numbers in the list. Also find the sum of the even numbers in the list. Compare the two sums and let the world\nknow your findings.",
  "Input": "Line #1 will consist of one integer N in the range [1,25] which indicates how many lines of data will follow. Each of the\nN lines of data will contain ten whole numbers in the range [0,9999]. The numbers in each data set will be separated by one\nwhitespace.",
  "Output": "Output one of the three messages for each date set.\n• If the even sum is greater, print \"Evens win by ? point(s)\" where ? is filled with the positive difference\nbetween the two sums.\n• If the odd sum is greater, print \"Odds win by ? point(s)\" where ? is filled with the positive difference\nbetween the two sums.\n• If the sums are equal, print the message \"It's a tie!!!\""
