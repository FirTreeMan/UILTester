  "Body": "Christie is so intrigued with numbers and their properties. She of course adores prime numbers (and who doesn't?), but she also\nis very interested in other types of numbers like Fibonacci Numbers, Happy Numbers, Evil Numbers, Fermat numbers, etc. She\nis determined to create her own special numbers and name them Christie Numbers.\n\nSo, this is what she has decided to do.\n\nA Christie Number is a whole number in which the sum of the squares of the digits is a perfect square.\n\nExample: 148 is a Christie Number:\n\n<img/>\n\nSince 81 is a perfect square, 148 is a Christie Number.\n\nChristie will give you two integers A and B where you are guaranteed that A < B. Your task is to check every natural number\nfrom A to B (inclusive) and to list the Christie numbers in that range in order from smallest to greatest.",
  "Input": "Line #1 will consist of one integer N in the range [1,25] which indicates how many lines of data will follow. Each of the\nN lines of data will contain two integers A, then B. Both numbers are in the range [1,9999].",
  "Output": "Output a list of Christie Numbers in the range [A,B] written horizontally with one white space in between each. If\nthere are no Christie numbers in that range, print \"NONE\"."
