  "Body": "Lucas is a track coach keeping \"track\" of his runners' times in the \"Uphill Mountain Running/Climbing Challenge\" - the\nUMRCC. It is important for him to be very aware of the progress of each member of the team.\n\nLucas will give you a list of times in seconds for each of his runners. Your job is to examine the list and send him back the\naverage time for each runner written in minutes and seconds.\n\nIf the seconds come out to be a decimal number, round down to the whole second. Or as he told us, \"chop off the decimal.\"\n\nNow Lucas realizes that everybody has a bad day and a super-great day from time-to-time. He would like you to drop the fastest\n<u>and</u> the slowest time for each runner if they have at least three times listed. If a runner has only one or two recorded times, do\nnot drop any scores - because you can't. Each runner will have at least one time, guaranteed.",
  "Input": "Line #1 will consist of one integer N in the range [1,25] which indicates how many lines of data will follow. Each of the\nN lines of data will contain a list of whole number times separated by one white space. On each line there will be T numbers\nwhere T is in the range [1,20].",
  "Output": "Output the average time. Drop the fastest and slowest times if there are at least three times in the list. The time should\nbe written in the following format. Minutes:Seconds where minutes will be an integer in the range [0,167] and seconds will be a\ntwo-digit number in the range [0,59]. There will be a colon in between the two numbers. There should be no whitespace in your\nanswers. If seconds calculate to be a decimal, truncate the value. For example, 34.97 seconds would truncate to 34 with no\ndecimal."
