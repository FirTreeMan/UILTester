  "Body": "Christine is learning how to use loops in Computer Science class. Her teacher has given her a challenge problem that will\ndemonstrate her skill with using loops. Your job is to create that program so that she may use yours as a guide should she have\nproblems.\n\nYour program should read in exactly six positive integers, each no larger than 32. We will call those integers A, B, C, D, E, and\nF.\n\nThe program will print five lines of output. Each line will consist of from 1 to 32 integers as described below.\n\tLine 1: Print all the integers from A to B.\n\tLine 2: Print all the integers from B to C.\n\tLine 3: Print all the integers from C to D.\n\tLine 4: Print all the integers from D to E.\n\tLine 5: Print all the integers from E to F.\n\nHer teacher gave her three situations to consider:\n\t(1) What if the first number is less than the next.\n\t(2) What if the first number is greater than the next.\n\t(3) What if the two numbers are equal.\n\nHer teacher also told her to look very closely at the sample outputs below.",
  "Input": "Input will consist of six integers (A, B, C, D, E, F). Each integer will be in range [1,32].",
  "Output": "The five lines of output will consist of all integers with integers separated by one space:\n1: from A to B\n2: from B to C\n3: from C to D\n4: from D to E\n5: from E to F"
