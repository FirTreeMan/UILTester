  "Body": "Krishna is intrigued by a song she heard on the radio during December.\n\nTaking the words to the song literally:\n\n\tOn the first day, 1 gift was given. (1)\n\tOn the second day, 3 gifts were given (1+2)\n\tOn the third day, 6 gifts were given. (1+2+3)\n\tOn the fourth day, 10 gifts were given. (1+2+3+4)\n\tOn the fifth day, 15 gifts were given. (1+2+3+4+5)\n\nSo, if Krishna wanted to know how many gifts were received from Day #3 to Day #5, the answer would be a total of 31 gifts\n(6+10+15).\n\nHelp Krishna write a program to allow her to input two integers A and B representing two different days in the song. The output\nshould be the total number of gifts received from the Day #A to Day #B.",
  "Input": "Input will consist of an integer N, the number of test cases. The number of test cases will be in range [1,20]. Each\nsubsequent line will contain two integers A and B representing two different days, both in the range [1,100] where A <= B. ",
  "Output": "Each line of output will consist of one integer representing the number of gifts received from Day #A to Day #B."
