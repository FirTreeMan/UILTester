  "Body": "You and Liza have been given detention! It is your job to sort through all recent student assignment grades and print out the top\nthree scores, mean, and median scores for each assignment.",
  "Input": "The first line will contain a single integer n (0 < n < 50) that indicates the number of data sets that follow. Each\ndata set will begin with a line containing the name of the assignment you are currently working on (this name may contain\nspaces). The following line will contain an integer m (5 < m < 50), denoting how many students have grades for this\nparticular assignment. The next m lines will contain a students’ first and last name, followed by an integer denoting their grade,\nwith no spaces, all separated by commas. ",
  "Output": "For each data set, output the following: The first line will contain the name of the assignment and nothing more. The\nnext 3 lines will be the names and grades of the top 3 scoring students on the assignment (any ties will be broken alphabetically,\nso if two students have the same score, the one with the alphabetically first name will be listed first. Sort by last name, then if\nthose are equal, sort by first name. There will never be two students with the same first and last name), in the following format:\n<First Name> <Last Name>: <Grade for this assignment>. After these three lines, you will output the mean\nscore for the assignment, formatted to 2 decimal places, and on its own line, preceded by the string “MEAN SCORE: ”. The last\nline of output for each case will consist of the string “MEDIAN SCORE: ” followed by the median score for the assignment,\nformatted to one decimal place. Each test case should be separated by an empty line, however there should be no extra empty\nline at the end of the last data set."
