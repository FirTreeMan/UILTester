  "Body": "Sunil has been working hard to prepare for this year’s UIL programming contests. He feels fairly confident about the written\ntest and most programming techniques but is still unsure of his skills for working with 2-dimension arrays. He wants to build a\nprogram that can perform basic processing of arrays of various sizes. Nothing complicated, just basic input and simple output to\nconfirm proper handling of data.\n\nSunil has requested your assistance on this project, can you help?",
  "Input": "First line contains a single integer <b>T</b>the number of test cases that follow with 1 ≤ <b>T</b>≤ 10. Each test case starts with a line\ncontaining 2 integers separated by whitespace: <b>R</b>,the number of rows, and <b>C</b>,the number of columns, with both 2 ≤ <b>R</b>,<b>C</b>≤ 15.\nThat line will be followed by <b>R</b>lines of data with each containing <b>C</b>integers separated by whitespace with integers in (-100,100).",
  "Output": " For each test case, output four lines. First line contains <b>R</b>numbers, one for each row of the array which is the average\nof data items in that row. Second line contains <b>C</b>numbers, one for each column of the array which is the average of data items\nin that column. Third line contains a single number, the average of all data items. All averages must be rounded to two decimal\nplaces and displayed right-aligned in fields that are 8 positions wide with two decimal places. The last line follows previous\nlines with 25 equal signs “=========================” starting in column 1."
