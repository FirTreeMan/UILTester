  "Body": "Your neighbor, Brian, is a milk delivery man. He drives a rather peculiar route though. Some of the streets he drives down take\nhim back in time. Because of this, he makes sure to never take the same street twice when running his route. He has a rather\nimportant client he must deliver milk to next week, and he has been stressing trying to figure out what the shortest route to him is\ngiven this complication. He remembers you talking about finding shortest paths recently in your Computer Science class, so he\nhas asked you to help him with this task.",
  "Input": "The first input line will contain a single number N (1 <= N <= 100) that denotes the number of test cases that follow.\nEach test case will start with two space-separated integers D and S (1 <= D, S <= 10^4), being the number of milk drop-off\nlocations, and the number of streets connecting these locations. The following S lines will contain three space-separated values:\nthe names of two locations followed by an integer value denoting the number of minutes it takes to travel between them. The\nfinal line of each test case will contain two space-separated values Start and Stop denoting the name of the starting drop-off and\nthe name of the finishing drop-off respectively.",
  "Output": "The smallest amount of time it would take Brian to reach the stop location from the start location. If the amount of\ntime is nondeterministic, print out “Take as long as you need.”."
