  "Body": "Your friend Luke has begun working as a plumber. He needs you to write a program to determine the maximum water flow\nbetween two points in a given network of pipes, while respecting the maximum capacity of each pipe. Each pipe will connect\nbetween two “nodes” in the network, and will have a capacity associated with it denoting the maximum amount of water that can\nflow through the given pipe at a time.",
  "Input": "The input will begin with two space-separated integers, n (0 < n <= 1000) and m (0 < m <= 1000), denoting the\nnumber of pipes in the network, and the number of test cases to follow, respectively. Each of the following n lines will contain a\npipe, with each pipe will be denoted by two space-separated characters, a and b, denoting the two nodes connected by this pipe\n(from a to b, not the other way around), followed by an integer denoting the capacity of the pipe. The next m lines will contain 2\ncharacters, separated by a space, denoting the two nodes you need to find the maximum flow between. Note: the maximum flow\nwill never exceed 100.",
  "Output": "For each test case, output the integer value denoting the maximum flow between the two given nodes."
