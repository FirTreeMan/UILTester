  "Body": "Erbatur loves spending his summers in the Bahamas but has always struggled to pick which of the islands in the Bahamas to stay\nat. One factor that is important to Erbatur is how large of an island he is staying on. More specifically, the length of the\ncoastline (where the ocean meets the land of the island) plays a large factor in how much Erbatur enjoys where he stays.\nKnowing that planning trips is a large undertaking, rather than look at the entire map of the Bahamas, Erbatur decides to look at\nonly a subsection of the map and wants to know how long the total coastline is of all islands contained within his view. Help\nErbatur write a program that automates this process.\n\n<img/>",
  "Input": "The first line of input will consist of a single integer, <i>T</i> (1 ≤ <i>T</i> ≤ 10<sup>2</sup>), denoting the number of test cases to follow.\nEach test case will begin with a single line of two space-separated integers <i>n</i> and <i>m</i> (1 ≤ <i>n</i>, <i>m</i> ≤ 10<sup>3</sup>) denoting the size of the\n<i>n</i> × <i>m</i> map-view to follow. The next <i>n</i> lines will each consist of <i>m</i> characters, each of which is either a '.' to represent water, or\na '#' to represent land. You may assume that the map-view of each test case is surrounded by ocean.",
  "Output": "For each of Erbaturs’s <i>T</i> queries, each on their own line, output a single integer <i>ℓ<sub>i</sub></i> denoting the total length of the\ncoastline of all islands, the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> of which corresponds to Erbatur’s <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> query. Note that water that appears within a given map view\nis not guaranteed to be a part of the ocean. For a cell of water to be considered a part of the ocean, it must be connected to the\nborder of the map only through other cells of water."
