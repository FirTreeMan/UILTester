  "Body": "Michaela and her friends have created a new way to communicate with each other that utilizes a series of dots (.) and dashes (-)\nto make sentences or phrases. They’ve done this so that they can communicate with each other without their nosy teacher, Miss\nDolores Umbridge, from eavesdropping on their conversations. They’ve utilized the ASCII values of the capital letters ‘A’-’Z’\nas well as the ASCII value for the ‘ ‘ (space) to create the representations as seen below. Now that their language is created, they\nneed your help in writing a program that can translate an English phrase or sentence into their new language. Can you help them\nwrite such a program?\n\n<img/>",
  "Input": "Input will begin with an integer M, the number of messages to convert. M will be in range of [1,20]. The following M\nlines will contain a single message made up of one or more words. Valid messages will be made up of both upper and lower case\nletters and spaces only. NOTE: even though input can be lower case, all the output will match that of the table above, i.e. upper\ncase letters only.",
  "Output": "For each message you are to output: “Message #: series_of_dots_or_dashes series_of_dots_or_dashes …”. There\nshould be a space between each series_of_dots_or_dashes to denote the beginning and end of a letter. Each message is to be\noutput on its own, individual line."
