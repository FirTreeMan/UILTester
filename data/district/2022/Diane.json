  "Body": "Diane simply wants to add two values that may be integers, proper fractions, or mixed numbers.\n\nWrite a program to take two values and find the sum in simplified format.",
  "Input": "The first line consists of a number N, representing the number of lines of data to follow. N will be in the range of [1,50].\nThe next N lines of data consist of two numeric values A and B, separated by the lower-case word \"and\". One space separates\nvalue A from \"and\". Another space separates \"and\" from value B.\n\nIf A or B are proper fractions, the format will be numerator, slash (\"/\"), then denominator with no spaces.\n\nIf A or B are mixed numbers, the format will be integer followed by one space then the proper fraction as mentioned above.\n\nIf a proper fraction is negative, the negative will be in the numerator. If a mixed number is negative, the negative will be\nattached to the integer.\n\nAll values will be in the range [-1000,1000].",
  "Output": "Each output will be either an integer, a fraction, or a mixed number representing the sum of the two values.\nIf the sum is an integer, it will be written in integer form.\nIf the sum is a proper fraction, it shall be written in lowest terms in numerator/denominator form with no spaces separating the\nnumerator from the \"/\", and no spaces separating the\"/\" from the denominator.\n\nOutput should be simplified and in lowest terms."
