  "Body": "Haru and his friend are playing a game called Spikebikes. In this game, each player programs their bike with a set of directions.\nThe bikes will then follow these movement instructions, leaving spikes behind them.\nBikes will crash if they run into a spike or another bike. Given each bikeâ€™s starting location and instruction set, determine the\noutcome of the game!",
  "Input": "The first line of input will consist of a single integer T (1 <= T <= 10), the number of test cases to follow.\nEach test case will begin with a single integer N, denoting the length of the instruction sequences.\nThe next two lines will be of the format X Y S and will denote the starting location and instruction sequences of players one and\ntwo, respectively. X and Y will be integers (0 <= X, Y <= 100) and S will be a string of length N containing characters {U, D, L,\nR} denoting movement in the {+Y, -Y, -X, +X} directions, respectively.\n\nCoordinates are a standard X-Y system, and locations less than zero and greater than 100 contain spikes and will crash a bike.\n\nNo test case will contain a head on collision at a spike location.",
  "Output": "For each test case, report one of the following outcomes:\n\t1) DRAW (if no bike crashes)\n\t2) DOUBLE SPIKE (if both bikes hit a spike at the same time)\n\t3) HEAD ON (if the bikes crash into each other)\n\t4) P1 WIN (if player 2 runs into a spike first)\n\t5) P2 WIN (if player 1 runs into a spike first)"
