  "Body": "Emily needs your help writing a program that reads in a simple mathematical expression consisting of an integer operand, a\nbinary operator, and another integer operand. The program should calculate the result of the mathematical operation and display\nit to the console.\n\nValid binary operators are:<ul><li>+ (performs addition)</li>\n<li>- (performs subtraction)</li>\n<li>X, x, and * (performs multiplication)</li>\n<li>/ (performs division)</li></ul>",
  "Input": "Input will consist of an integer N, the number of test cases. The number of test cases will be in range [1,20]. Each\nsubsequent line will contain the mathematical expression of the form: “operand1 + operand2”, “operand1 - operand2”,\n“operand1 X operand2”, “operand1 x operand2”, “operand1 * operand2”, or “operand1 / operand2”. operand1 and operand2 are\nguaranteed to be integers in range of [-255,255]. There will be a guaranteed space between operand1 and the binary operator, as\nwell as a guaranteed space between the binary operator and operand2. Note: the input will never consist of division by 0 and the\nremainder will be guaranteed to be a nonnegative number.",
  "Output": "For each mathematical expression, you are to output the original mathematical expression followed by a space, an\nequal sign, a space, and the result of the operation. For the division case only, you are to output the result of the integer division,\nfollowed by a space, “remainder”, space and the remainder of the division that was performed. See the Sample output."
