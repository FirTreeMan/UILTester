  "Body": "Mario is trying to create a new way to write words in code so he can leave secret messages to his friends. He has come up with\nan interesting way to encode a word.\n\nA word will be accompanied by an integer. That integer indicates how many letters at the front and at the back of a word that\nwill be swapped. For example, if the integer is 2 and the word is COMPUTER, the first two letters of COMPUTER \"CO\" will be\nplaced at the end of the word and the last two letters \"ER\" will move to the front.\n\nBut, to make it just a bit trickier, Mario will reverse the letters in each of the two blocks that are being swapped. Thus, in the\nexample above \"OC\" moves to the end and \"RE\" moves to the start.\n\n\t2 COMPUTER gives us REMPUTOC\n\t3 COMPUTER gives us RETPUMOC\n\nMario noticed that there would be two special cases.\n\nIf the integer is larger than the number of letters in the word, the output is \"error\".\n\n\t7 MOUSE gives us error\n\nIf the integer does not trigger an error as mentioned above, but is more than half the length of the word, the result would be\nsimply the reversal of the original word.\n\n\t4 TEXAS gives us SAXET\n\nWrite the program to allow Mario to encode his words.",
  "Input": "Input will consist of an integer N, the number of test cases. The number of test cases will be in range [1,20]. Each\nsubsequent line will contain one integer in the range [1,100] followed by one space then a string consisting only of upper-case\nletters. The strings will contain no spaces and no punctuation marks. The string will be of length [1,100].",
  "Output": "Each line of output will consist of one string of characters representing the \"rearranged\" solution. If the inputs create an\nerror code mentioned above, the output will be \"error\" written in all lower-case letters. "
