  "Input": "Input will consist of an integer N, the number of test cases. The number of test cases will be in range [1,20]. Each\nsubsequent line will contain one integer in the range [1,1000000] representing the number to be tested.",
  "Output": "Each line of output will consist of one integer representing the greatest common factor of the input with its reverse."
