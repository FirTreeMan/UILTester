  "Body": "Rishita’s classmate Sunny solved a programming problem from the Invitational A contest about dual-credit courses. She found\nthe resulting list of courses from Sunny’s contest problem very useful and has accepted a challenge to expand the list by\nincluding more data and a different sort. Rishita is as excited as Sunny about taking UIL programming and developing her\nskills! The previous data from the Texas Common Course Numbering System (TCCNS) included only course codes and titles\nbut now contains the names of the schools that offer the courses. Courses may be offered by more than one school.\n\nCan you help Rishita implement a multi-level sort?",
  "Input": "An unknown number of lines, greater than 1 and less than 100. Each line contains a course title followed by a course\ncode and the name of the school offering the course. Items are separated by commas and there are no other punctuation or\nspecial characters except for the dash in the course codes.",
  "Output": "A sorted list, first by school as the major sort then by course number as the minor sort, both alphabetical (A…Z). List\nwill be formatted as shown in the sample output with the school listed once and the list of courses indented by 3 spaces\ncontaining the course code first followed by the course title, separated by 3 spaces."
