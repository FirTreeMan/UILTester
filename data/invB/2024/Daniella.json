  "Body": "Daniella is concerned with words. She is always thinking about words. She has always been that way. She understands language\nand loves to think about words.\n\nIn her job as a chef, she is in charge of preparing meals for the customers in a fancy restaurant. In that job, she cooks great meals\nand is in charge of every step in the process. One of those steps is chopping up the vegetables. She is known world-wide for her\nchopping skills.\n\nEvery once in a while, her mind wanders, and in her daydreams, she combines her two interests. Sometimes even, she imagines\nchopping words. Your job is to write a program to \"chop\" words into pieces.\n\nYou will be given a String S and an integer N. Your job is to chop S into groups containing N letters each. Between each word\npiece, you will place a dash, but you will not have a dash at the beginning or the end of the word. As you move across the word\nfrom left to right, place dashes after each group of N letters. The last group may be shorter than the rest if there are not enough\nletters to create a group of N.\n\nExamples:\n\tCOMPUTER 2 produces CO-MP-UT-ER\n\tGLASS 1 produces G-L-A-S-S\n\tPROGRAM 3 produces PRO-GRA-M\n\tFROG 5 produces FROG "
