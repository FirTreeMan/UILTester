  "Body": "Donghai helped Joan solve the Invitational A problem counting words and calculating the average size of words. Now, he wants\nto work with letters instead of words. He wants to count the number of times each letter occurs in written prose. He will ignore\npunctuation marks and any other non-alphabetic characters. Uppercase and lowercase letters are considered the same letter.\nOnce they have been counted, he will display the list of letters that occurred.\n\nCan you help Donghai solve this problem?",
  "Input": "First line will contain an integer N with 0 < N ≤ 10 which is the number of paragraphs that follow. Each paragraph will\noccur on a single line of text and will not exceed 2000 characters in total length. Any ASCII character can occur in a paragraph\nbut the only ones of interest are the standard alphabetic letters, both uppercase A…Z and lowercase a…z.",
  "Output": "Each test case must display list of letters in uppercase that have non-zero counts. Each output line with a letter will\nstart with that letter followed by a colon “:” followed by the count with no spaces. Following each test case display a line\ncontaining 10 equal signs “==========”."
