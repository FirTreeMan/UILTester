  "Body": "Tyler is a rich philanthropist and is a big fan of the trend of “doubling it and giving it to someone else.” This trend consists of\nstarting with a single dollar and giving participants the option of either doubling the current dollar amount and giving it to\nsomeone else, or keeping the current amount of money for themselves. This continues until someone chooses to take the money\nfor themselves. Due to Tyler’s large wealth, he has larger ambitions.\n\nRather than simply doubling the current amount of money and giving it to someone else, Tyler prefers giving his participants\noptions of what to multiply the current amount of money by. As a result, he is curious whether certain dollar amounts are\nobtainable given a list of options to multiply the current amount of money by. You have been contracted by Tyler to develop a\nprogram which can help him automatically solve such a problem.",
  "Input": "The first line of input will consist of two integers, <i>n</i> and <i>m</i> – the number of options for multipliers and the number of\nqueries, respectively. The next line will consist of a list of <i>n</i> space-separated integer multipliers. The following line will consist\nof a list of <i>m</i> space-separated integer queries indicating target dollar amounts that Tyler is interested in. It should be noted that\n1 ≤ <i>n</i>, <i>m</i> ≤ 10<sup>3</sup>",
  "Output": "For each of the <i>m</i> queries, print on its own line the string “Target <<i>t</i>>: <ANS>”, where <<i>t</i>> is the <i>i</i>th target and\n<ANS> is the string “YES” or “NO” corresponding to whether or not the <i>i</i>th target is obtainable using any sequence of the <i>m</i>\nmultipliers, each of which can be used any number of times.
