  "Body": "There is a lot of controversy this year because of the selections made to the Pickle Ball play-offs. There was so much discussion\nas to which teams made the Top Four. We will be talking about this for a long time.\n\nBilly has been charged with finding a program that will find the winner among the eight schools in the league. He is given their\nnames and their win-loss records. He must find the school with the highest winning percentage.\n\nNow of course, due to a recent court decision, there will always be a clear winner after all the games are played. There is a\nguarantee not to have a tie for first place. So, it is all based on which team has the best winning percentage, even though teams\npossibly played a different number of games.\n\nIn the sample, Texas has the highest winning percentage at 90.9% with a record of 10 wins and 1 loss.",
  "Input": "There will be 16 lines of data. The odd numbered lines will be the team names. Each team name will be of length in the\nrange [1,20]. Some teams may have spaces in their names. On the even numbered lines, there will be two integers, both in the\nrange [0,24]. There will be one space between separating the numbers that are on each line. The first number is the number of\nwins. The second number is the number of losses. The win-loss record will always be on the line below the team name.",
  "Output": "Output the name of the team with the highest winning percentage."
