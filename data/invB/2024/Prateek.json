  "Input": "The first line will consist of a single integer, <i>n</i>, denoting the number of lines to follow. The next <i>n</i> lines will each consist of a\nspace-separated list of sorted integers. It should be noted that 1 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 50, and the length of any given list will be no more than\n100.",
  "Output": "For each of the \uD835\uDC5B sorted lists, output the analysis of the list as follows: on the first line, print the string\n“List: <LIST>”, where <LIST> is a space-separated string representation of the sorted list. Then, for each unique set\ngenerated by Prateek’s program, print out “<i>i</i>-iterations: <SET>”, where <i>i</i> is the number of iterations needed to find the\nelements contained in <SET>, and <SET> is a space-separated string representation of the sorted set of elements which all take <i>i</i>\niterations of the binary search algorithm to find. Print out the sets in increasing order in relation to the value of <i>i</i>. "
