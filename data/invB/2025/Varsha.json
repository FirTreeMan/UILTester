  "Body": "You are playing Minecraft, and a new kind of ore, Varsha, has been added in the latest update. You, being the expert\nMinecrafter you are, have given yourself a mission. You are setting out to find the largest “vein” of Varsha in a given chunk. A\n“vein” is a contiguous blob of a certain ore, where every block of that ore in that blob is directly contiguous to another block of\nthe same ore. Blocks can only be contiguous in 6 directions, up, down, left, right, forward and backward.",
  "Input": "The input will begin with an integer, n (0 < n <= 1000), denoting the number of test cases to follow. Each test case\nwill begin with 3 integers, d, r, and c, denoting the number of levels, rows, and columns in the given chunk to be scanned. The\nfollowing r lines will each contain c characters denoting all the characters in the first level of the chunk. All d levels will be\ngiven in this manner, with r lines of c characters denoting each level.\nThe chunks will be made up of the following characters:\n<ul><li># – Denotes a dirt block.\n</li><li>* – Denotes a diamond ore block.\n</li><li>V – Denotes a Varsha ore block.\n</li><li>@ – Denotes a stone block.\n</li><li>o – Denotes a redstone ore block.\n</li><li>% - Denotes a gravel block.</li></ul>",
  "Output": "For each chunk, output the size of the largest “vein” of Varsha you find."
