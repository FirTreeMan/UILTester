  "Body": "Your math professor is not having a good time lately. He has given the class an assignment to determine the best strategy to win\nthe “Pranav” game, a game he made up that is conveniently named after himself. You will be given a line of “pots” of gold,\neach pot worth a given number of points. Each round of the game, you select the “pot” on either end of the line, take it and add\nit to your total, and then your opponent does the same. Determine the best possible score you can get, and if that number will\nwin you the game (the goal is to have a larger total than your opponent). You can assume that your opponent will play\noptimally.\n\n\tExample: 5, 3, 7, 10\n\tAnswer: Winner 15\n\nYou choose 10, opponent chooses 7, you choose 5, opponent chooses 3: (10 + 5) = 15 > (7 + 3) = 10",
  "Input": "The input will begin with an integer, n (0 < n <= 1000), denoting the number of test cases to follow. Each test case\nwill consist of an unknown number of space-separated integers denoting the “pots” of gold the game is to be played with. There\nwill always be an even number of “pots”.",
  "Output": "For each best possible score, if you are the winner, output the string “Winner”, if you are the loser, output the string\n“Loser”, otherwise output “Tie”. After that string, output a space, followed by the best possible score you could get."
