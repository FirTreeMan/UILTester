  "Body": "Louis has been working hard to improve his programming skills hoping to help his team get to Regionals. His younger sister is\ncurrently learning algebra and has been working with quadratic functions. He remembers the following:\n\n<img/>\n\nLouis has decided to write a program to help his sister check her work. The program must produce the correct number of and\nvalues for any root that exists along with the minimum or maximum. He has requested your assistance to make sure he gets it\ncorrect.",
  "Input": "First line contains a single positive integer <b>T</b>, the number of test cases that follow with <b>T</b> ≤ 25. Each test case contains a\nsingle line with 3 numbers separated by whitespace: values for <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>c</b> that define the function as shown above. The\nnumbers will be in [-1000.000, 1000.000] with roots, minimums. and maximums in the range [-100000.000, 100000.000].",
  "Output": "For each test case, output 1 of the following lines as shown but with only “min” or only “max” as appropriate. The\nfirst number listed after min/max is the min or max value and the second number is the location. All numbers must be rounded to\n3 decimal places with as many digits before the decimal point as needed and no extra spaces; however, when the value is in\n(−1.0, 1.0) it must have a leading 0. When there are 2 roots, the first one listed must be the leftmost root.\n\n\tFunction has 2 roots at 9.999 and 9.999 with a min/max of 9.999 at 9.999\n\tFunction has 1 root at 9.999 with a min/max of 9.999 at 9.999\n\tFunction has no roots with a min/max of 9.999 at 9.999\n\tFunction is not quadratic"
