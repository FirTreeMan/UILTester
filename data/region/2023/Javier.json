  "Body": "To conclude \"International Trapezoid Week,\" Javier wants a program that will display his favorite trapezoids – right trapezoids.\nThese are trapezoids with exactly two right angles.\n\nIn creating the program, Javier wants you to consider trapezoids where the smaller base is \"on top\" and other trapezoids where\nthe smaller base is at the \"bottom.\"\n\nHe also wants you to consider trapezoids where the 90 degree angles are both on the left side and others where the 90 degree\nangles are both on the right side.\n\nFinally, he wants the trapezoids to be drawn with the character of his choosing.\n\nLook closely at the samples below.\n\nPlease write the program for him.",
  "Input": "The first line contains a single positive integer T, the number of test cases that follow with T ≤ 25. Each test case will be\na line of data containing the following items. Each item is separated by one space.\n\n\t(1) The measure of the top base (B1). It will be an integer in the range [1,50]\n\n\t(2) The measure of the bottom base (B2). It will be an integer in the range [1,50]\n\n\t(3) One printable character (Ch)\n\n\t(4) One character (Side) that is either an uppercase 'R' or an uppercase 'L'",
  "Output": "Each set of output will be a right trapezoid. It will be composed of multiple Ch's. The first line of the trapezoid will\nhave B1 characters. The subsequent lines will either decrease or increase by one until the bottom base of B2 is reached. If Side\nis 'R', the 90 degree angles will be on the right. If Side is 'L', the 90 degree angles will be on the left."
