  "Body": "Fernando loves factors, and don't we all? He loves to explore common factors, prime factors, odd factors, and perfect square\nfactors. He loves all types. But he is also very superstitious. He does not like the digit \"7.\" He won't tell us why. We just\naccept it as a part of what Fernando is all about. So, when he sees the factors of a number, he does not like to see any factor that\ncontains the digit \"7\". To Fernando, \"7\" is a bad digit.\n\nSo, he wants you to write a program that will allow the user to see all the factors or a number, except for those factors that\ncontain the \"bad\" digit which could be any digit. He wants the program so flexible that a user can enter any bad digit from 0 to\n9, because even though this program is called \"Fernando,\" life isn't always about Fernando.",
  "Input": "The first line contains a single positive integer <b>T</b>, the number of test cases that follow with <b>T â‰¤ 25</b>. Each test case\ncontains a single line with 2 integers <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>. <b>A</b> is in the range [1,1000000] and represents the number to be factored. <b>B</b> is a\nsingle digit in the range [0,9] and it represents the \"bad\" digit.",
  "Output": "Each line of output will be a list of the factors of <b>A</b> that do not contain the digit <b>B</b>. These numbers should be listed\nhorizontally in increasing order with a space separating each number. If there are no factors that can be printed, print \"NONE\"\nfor that test case."
