  "Body": "You are lost in space! Your ship’s AI, Vivek, is very upset with you for not taking the ship in for a check up at your last stop,\nand is berating you constantly. You need to very quickly find the quickest route to a space mechanic before you run out of fuel\nand are lost adrift in space. Vivek has very sarcastically given you the coordinates for every system in the area, but\nunfortunately your mapping systems are also down, so you must quickly fire up a program to find out if and how you’re going to\nget out of this alive. ",
  "Input": "The first line will contain a single integer n (0 < n < 20) that indicates the number of data sets that follow. Each data set\nwill begin with one line containing 3 floating-point values, x, y, and z (-1000000 < x,y,z < 1000000), the spatial coordinates of\nyour current location, followed by an integer g, denoting the amount of miles of fuel you have remaining. This will be followed\nby a line containing 1 integer, m, denoting the number of nearby systems to be inputted. Each of the following m lines will\nconsist of a string (containing no spaces or whitespace), denoting the name of the system, followed by a Boolean value, denoting\nwhether or not the system has a mechanic, followed by 3 doubles, a, b, and c, denoting the spatial coordinates of the system.\n\n<b>Distance Calculating:</b> Use the standard 3-point system distance formula shown below to calculate the distances to adjacent\nsystems:\n\n<img/>",
  "Output": "Each data set will only have one line of output. If it is impossible to make it to any space mechanics without running\nout of fuel, output the line “SS Madame de Pompadour”. If it is possible to make it to a mechanic shop, output “We made\nit Rick: “, followed by the total number of mechanic shops that can be reached. "
