  "Body": "Neeraj’s dad owns a house building company, and is having trouble finding workers that are good at both carpentry and math.\nThe problem being, the workers have smart phones and can use them to perform the arithmetic needed to determine the length of\nboards to cut, but the result is a decimal number that the workers are having a hard time relating to their measuring tapes. For\nexample, if a worker needs to cut a joist that spans both the bathroom and closet, the addition performed is 12’ 6 ¾” + 6’ 7 ⅛”\nresulting in a decimal number of 229.875 inches. Since the measuring tapes are marked in fractions of an inch, Neeraj’s dad’s\nworkers are having trouble determining what fraction .875 corresponds to.\n\nNeeraj’s dad has asked Neeraj to write a program that is able to take in a decimal number and output the corresponding, reduced,\nfraction. So, for a decimal number of .875, the program would need to output 7/8.\n\nDo you think you can help Neeraj write such a program?",
  "Input": "The first line contains a single integer n that indicates the number of data sets that follow. n is guaranteed to be in\nrange of [1,20]. Each data set consists of a single decimal number d, where d is in range (0.0, 1.0).",
  "Output": "For each test case, you are to output “d is equal to REDUCED_FRACTION”. For example, when d is .875, the\noutput should be: .875 is equal to 7/8"
