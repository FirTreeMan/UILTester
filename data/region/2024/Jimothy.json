  "Body": "You and Jimothy have a paper on Binary Search tree traversals due tomorrow. Write a program that will, given a list of strings,\ngenerate a binary search tree, and run a pre-order, in-order, post-order, and reverse-order traversal on it. You should construct\nthe binary search tree as normal, and the traversals should be as normal as well.",
  "Input": "The input will begin with an integer, n (0 < n <= 1000), denoting the number of test cases to follow. Each test case\nwill consist of an unknown number of space-separated strings to be put into the binary search tree. They should be inserted into\nthe tree in the order given, duplicates should be inserted into the left side of the tree.",
  "Output": "First output the string \"TEST CASE #n:\", where n is replaced with the number of the test case, starting at 1. Then,\non the following line, output the string \"PRE-ORDER TRAVERSAL: \", the elements of the tree after being traversed in pre-\norder, all separated by spaces. Then, on the following line, output the string \"IN-ORDER TRAVERSAL: \", the elements of\nthe tree after being traversed in in-order, all separated by spaces. Then, on the following line, output the string \"POST-ORDER\nTRAVERSAL: \", the elements of the tree after being traversed in post-order, all separated by spaces. Then, on the following\nline, output the string \"REVERSE-ORDER TRAVERSAL: \", the elements of the tree after being traversed in reverse-order, all\nseparated by spaces"
