  "Body": "Little Bob is a fifth grader who is learning about order of operations in arithmetic. His teacher is emphasizing the fact that one\nmust do multiplication before addition.\n\nLittle Bob's class has just completed a unit on putting numbers in order. Little Bob's older brother Big Bob wants to help his\nsibling and at the same time practice his Java programming. So, he has given his brother a challenge to do. While the younger\nBob is solving the problem by hand, Big Bob will write a program to check the work.\n\nRead in five integers, no one number is equal to any of the other four. Sort the integers from largest to smallest creating a list we\nwill call A, B, C, D, and E where A is the largest value and E is the smallest. Plug the numbers into the following math\nexpression and find the value.\n\n<img/>\n\nGo ahead and write the program, for all the Bobs out there. They are counting on you.",
  "Input": "First line contains a single integer <b>T</b> representing the number of test cases that follow with <b>T</b> ≤ 10. Each test case is a\nline of exactly 5 integers separated by whitespace, each with a value in range [0, 100]. There will be no repeats on a line – that\nis, the five values will all be different.",
  "Output": "For each test case, output 1 integer representing: <b>A x B + C + D x E</b> where the five integers are sorted from largest to\nsmallest."
