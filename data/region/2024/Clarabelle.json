  "Body": "Clarabelle Ono has always been disappointed with her first name. Her Mom and Dad wanted their youngest child to have a very\nfancy name, so they gave her that 10-letter name. Their older children, Asa, Nan, Ava, Eve, Bob, and Ana all had three-letter\npalindrome names, but not Clarabelle.\n\nClarabelle owns a guinea pig farm and she is determined to name every one of her animals with a three-letter palindrome like her\nfamily. She is getting desperate. She now is looking at every work she encounters to see if somewhere inside, a three-letter\npalindrome is hidden. Please help her by writing a program.\n\nRead in a word written in all lowercase letters which contains [a,z]. The words you will test have lengths in the range of [3,12]\nletters. Your job is to print a list of three-letter palindromes that are hidden in the input word. These palindromes will consist of\nthree consecutive letters that appear in the word.\n\nYou will list the palindromes in alphabetical order, making sure to list each palindrome only one time.",
  "Input": "First line contains a single integer <b>T</b> representing the number of test cases that follow with <b>T</b> â‰¤ 10. Each test case will\nconsist of one word with at least 3 letters and not more than 12 letters. The words may not contain any other characters except\nfor lowercase letters",
  "Output": "For each test case, output an alphabetical list of three-letter palindromes using a single space to separate the words. If\nthere are no palindromes, output <b>NONE</b>."
