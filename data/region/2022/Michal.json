  "Body": "Michal’s school just got a new scrolling marquee sign, but the problem is, the sign didn’t come with a controller! Michal’s\nprincipal has asked Michal to write a program to convert all input into text to be displayed on the sign. Michal knows this is a\nbig undertaking, so he has decided to start with only the numerical digits 0-9 first.\n\nThe sign utilizes a seven-segment display. For example, if all 7 segments are turned on, you would get the numeral 8 as shown\nbelow:\n\n<img/>\n\nWith a combination of turning certain segments on or off, all digits 0-9 can be achieved as the table below shows:\n\n<img/>\n\nOutputting one number at a time wouldn’t be too hard programmatically, a switch statement or if-else statement could get the job\ndone in a jiffy. The problem is, Michal’s principal wants to utilize the sign’s full potential and display multiple numbers at one\ntime. For example, if Michal’s principal wanted to display “0123456789” the sign would need to display:\n\n<img/>\n\nGiven an input number, can you help Michal write a program that outputs the input number on a single line surrounded by a box\nof asterisks (‘*’)?",
  "Input": "The input will consist of an integer <i>T</i>, the number of test cases. <i>T</i> will be in the range of <i>[1,20]</i>. For each test case, input\nwill consist of a single number with a minimum of one digit, and a maximum of 20 digits. The input will have no spaces and will\nconsist of the digits [0-9] only.",
  "Output": "For each test case, you are to output the number using the seven segment table above, in a single bounded box of\nasterisks"
