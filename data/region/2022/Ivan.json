  "Body": "Ivan has worked on an algorithm for scoring UIL written exams. All questions will be multiple choice with 5 choices, only one\nthat is correct. Correct answers will earn 6 points while incorrect answers will be penalized 2 points. Questions that are\nunanswered earn no points. He is unsure of his string handling skills and needs you to validate his algorithm.\n\nCan you help Ivan implement his scoring algorithm?",
  "Input": ": First line of data file contains a positive integer T, the number of exams that will be scored with 1 ≤ T ≤ 25. The next\nline will contain a single string with exactly 40 uppercase letters from { A, B, C, D, E }. Each letter is the correct answer for one\nof the 40 questions with the first letter for the first question and the remaining letters in sequence to the last question. The\nfollowing T lines will then contain a single string with exactly 40 uppercase letters from the same set or an underscore ‘_’ which\nindicates the question was not answered.",
  "Output": "For each exam, display one line with the score and the percentage of attempted questions that were correct. Format the\nline as shown below with the percentage correct rounded to 1 decimal place. If no questions are attempted, set the percentage to\n0.0."
