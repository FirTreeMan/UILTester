  "Body": "Feng just learned about the unit circle in her pre-calculus class. As she was leaving class, she realized that the hour and minute\nhands of an analog clock not only point to their respective hour and minute (representing the current time), but they each also\npoint to a degree in range of [0,359] corresponding to the unit circle representation. (See below figure.) Feng would like your\nhelp writing a program that takes in the time, and emits two angles, one for hour, and one for minute, corresponding to the angle\n(in degrees) each hand would be pointing at.\n\n<img/>",
  "Input": "Input starts with a line containing an integer N, the number of test cases. N will be in range [1,20]. The following N lines\ncontain the time, formatted as HH:MM. HH will be in range [1,12] and MM will be in range [0,59].",
  "Output": "For each test case, output the corresponding angle measures each of the two hands would be pointing to.\nHour angle (denoted as H_Angle below) and minute angle (denoted as M_Angle) will be guaranteed to be in range of [0,359].\nFormatting for the output should be ”Hour: H_Angle Minute: M_Angle”\n\nNote: H_Angle and M_Angle should be outputted to 1 (one) decimal place."
