  "Body": "Damian has always been intrigued by numbers. He is absolutely giddy about prime numbers, but honestly, he loves anything to\ndo with factors. He was investigating numbers and he found one type of number that he really liked. These are what he calls\n\"growing\" numbers. That is when, looking at the digits from left to right, they increase.\n\nHere are some examples: 123, 38, 1479, 5, 123456789\nThese are NOT growing numbers: 73, 762, 12557 (notice those two 5s)\n\nThen Damian got an idea, he wants to find the \"growing factors\" of a number. These are factors that meet the qualifications of\nbeing growing. Write a program to help him out. You will make Damian's day.\n\n<img/>",
  "Input": " Input will consist of an integer N, the number of test cases. The number of test cases will be in range [1,20]. Each\nsubsequent line will contain an integer in the range[1,1000000].",
  "Output": "Each line of output will be a line of \"growing factors\" listed in ascending order with a space between each number."
