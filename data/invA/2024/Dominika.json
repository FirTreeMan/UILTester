  "Body": "An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are the same length. An equilateral triangle is also equiangular,\nmeaning that all three interior angles are congruent and are each 60 degrees. For example, if the points (7,-6) and (1,2) are given,\ntwo equilateral triangles can be formed. The first triangle (dashed lines) is formed with the addition of the point A (-2.93,-7.2),\nand the second triangle (dotted lines) is formed with the addition of the point B (10.93,3.2). Note: these values are rounded to\ntwo decimal places.\n\n<img/>\n\nDominika has been given two coordinates representing two out of the three points on an equilateral triangle, but the third point is\nmissing. Can you help Dominika write a program that is able to find these two missing points?",
  "Input": "First line will contain an integer N in range [1,20], the number of test cases. Each of the following N lines will contain\nfour whole numbers, separated by spaces. These numbers represent Ax Ay Bx By, where A and B are the two given points. All\nwhole numbers will be in range [-20,20].",
  "Output": "For each test case you are to output: “Test case: #” where # is the current test case, followed by the two points\nthat are missing, that are needed to make the two equilateral triangles. Each point is to be printed out on its own, individual line.\nAll output should be rounded and printed out to two decimal places. The point with the smallest x value should be output first. If\nboth x coordinates are the same, then output the point with the smallest y value."
