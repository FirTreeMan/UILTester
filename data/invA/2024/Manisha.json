  "Body": "Manisha is preparing for her boolean algebra exam where she will need to show mastery in her ability to write boolean equations\nfrom their equivalent digital electronics symbols. More specifically, Manisha will need to write several sums of products. A\nvalid sum consists of one or more variables (denoted by a single uppercase letter) with a possible negation tied to an individual\nvariable (denoted by the character ‘/’).\n\nWhile Manisha is confident in her abilities to derive those boolean equations, she is not so confident in her ability to format her\nanswer properly for the auto-grader to mark her answer as correct. For an answer to be marked as correct, it needs to be\nformatted as follows:\n\n<img/>\n\nHelp Manisha by writing her a program that will format her answer in the format mentioned above.",
  "Input": "The first line of input will consist of a single integer <i>n</i> (1 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 100) denoting the number of testcases to follow. The next <i>n</i>\nlines will each contain a single string indicating the sum of products that Manisha wishes to format properly. It is guaranteed that\neach product is fully simplified and therefore a given variable name will <b>not</b> appear more than once within a given product. ",
  "Output": "For each of Manisha’s <i>n</i> requests, on their own line, print a single string which is formatted as described above."
