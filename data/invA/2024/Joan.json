  "Body": "Joan really enjoys her programming class but her true passion is the English language. However, programming has caused her\nto view English writings somewhat differently and she realizes that words are simply pieces of data put together carefully to\ncreate a desired meaning. For now, she has decided to practice her programming skills by creating a program to perform a very\nsimple analysis of relatively small pieces of prose.\nJoan has big plans for analyzing written pieces but decided to start with a program that simply counts the number of words in a\nsample of prose and calculate the average length of all words.",
  "Input": "A sample of English prose with an unknown number of lines containing an unknown number of whitespace-separated\nwords on each line. The number of lines will be in the range [2,25]. Words may consist of both uppercase and lowercase letters\nand there are no non-letter symbols or numbers.",
  "Output": "A single line containing the number of words and the calculated average length of all words, formatted exactly as\nshown below in the sample output. The average length is rounded to the nearest whole number."
