  "Body": "Helen has taken over your Algebra class and is making all of you do all of her homework for the whole year. You need to write\na program to solve equations for Helen so that she doesn’t make you clap erasers.",
  "Input": "The input will begin with an integer, n (0 < n <= 1000), denoting the number of test cases to follow. Each test case\nwill consist of a string of characters denoting an equation, consisting of any of the following characters:\n<ul><li>term – A term will always be either a constant or a variable.\n</li><li>constant – A constant will be an integer value.\n</li><li>variable – A variable will be a single lowercase alphabetic character, which may or may not have a coefficient (a\nnumber before the variable denoting the number to multiply by the variable). The coefficient will always be an integer\n(positive or negative) if present.\n</li><li>symbol – A symbol will be one of the following 4 symbols (*, /, +, -).</li></ul>\nThe equation will always be in the following format <mark>with single spaces separating the items</mark>:\n\n\tterm symbol term = term\n\nIt is guaranteed that only one of the terms will be a variable (the other two will be constants).",
  "Output": "For each equation, output the variable that was solved for, followed by a space, an equal sign, another space, and the\ncorresponding value (rounded to 3 decimal places)."
