  "Body": "Valery just started her new job at the post office. During her onboarding, they explained something she found rather interesting\nabout how they make deliveries between other post offices. Each post office makes some number of deliveries each day to other\npost offices. The delivery driver at each office must wait for all packages to arrive from the expecting offices before making\ntheir delivery runs. Since Valery knows youâ€™re so good at programming, she has asked you to write a program telling her what\norder the post offices will make their deliveries.",
  "Input": "The first line of input will contain a number N (1 <= N <= 100) denoting the number of post offices. Each following\nline will contain two values, S and M (1 <= M <= 100) being the name of the post office and the number of deliveries that driver\nmust make respectively. The following line will contain M space separated values denoting the names of post offices to make\ndeliveries to.\n\nNote: There will always be at least one post office which does not need to wait for any other deliveries.",
  "Output": "Output the correct ordering of deliveries, arrow separated as shown in sample output, such that each post office driver\nwaits for all deliveries before leaving. If there are multiple, output the lexicographically smallest."
