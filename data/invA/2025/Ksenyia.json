  "Body": "You have created a website with your friend Ksenyia. Your job is to build a program the validity of given passwords and\nusernames. There is a list of rules for both as follows:\n\n<b><u>Username Rules</u>:</b>\n<ul><li>Every username must begin with a capital letter.\n</li><li>Usernames can only be made up of letters and digits.\n</li><li>A username has maximum length of 20 and minimum length of 8.\n</li><li>Any username that has been used before cannot be used after it is set the first time.</li></ul>\n<b><u>Password Rules</u>:</b>\n<ul><li>Passwords must contain at least one digit, capital letter, lowercase letter, and special character (!@#$%^&*?+).\n</li><li>A password has maximum length of 30 and minimum length of 10.\n</li><li>Any password that has been used before cannot be used after it is set the first time.\n</li><li>A password cannot have 3 or more duplicate characters in a row.\n</li><li>A password cannot contain any spaces.</li></ul>\nUsernames/passwords will only be used if both are valid, so a valid username with an invalid password has not been used.",
  "Input": "The input will begin with an integer, n (0 < n <= 1000), denoting the number of test cases to follow. Each test case\nwill consist of two lines, with the first containing the username, and the second containing the password for a given user.",
  "Output": "For each test case, if both username and password are valid output the string “Valid”, if neither is valid output the\nstring “Both Invalid”. If only the username is valid output the string “Password Invalid”, and if only the password if\nvalid output the string “Username Invalid”."
