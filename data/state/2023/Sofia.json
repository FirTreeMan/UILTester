  "Body": "Sofia has previously written a program to calculate wind chill or “feels like” temperatures when it is cold, but many areas of Texas\ndo not experience the extreme cold weather. Instead, Texans often suffered the dreaded high temperature and high humidity\ncombination that leads to dangerous heat warnings, so she has decided to write a similar program for calculating heat index or\n“apparent” temperature.\n\nSofia’s search across the Internet has revealed heat index (<b>HI</b>) calculations are more complicated than windchill and involve several\nformulas and special rules. It starts with the ambient air temperature (<b>t</b>) measured in Fahrenheit (°F) and relative humidity (<b>h</b>) as\na percentage between 0 and 100, inclusive.\n\nThe first step is to use the following formula which handles the lower side of the temperature range. When the result is less than\n80, this is the calculated <b>HI</b>.\n\n<img/>\n\nOtherwise, continue with the general formula and two possible adjustments:\n\n<img/>\n\nFinally, when the calculated heat index is over 140 °F or below 75 °F it is considered invalid and should not be displayed as a\nheat index.",
  "Input": "First line of input will contain a single integer as the number of test cases, N, with range 2 ≤ <b>N</b> ≤ 50. Each test case consists\nof two floating point values on one line separated by whitespace: ambient air temperature <b>t</b> (°F) with range 50.0 ≤ <b>t</b> ≤ 140.0 and\nrelative humidity <b>h</b> with range 0.0 ≤ <b>h</b> ≤ 100.0.",
  "Output": "A single line starting with “Test case #” followed by no space and the test case number and a colon as shown in\nsample output. That is then followed by exactly 1 space and then either the computed heat index rounded to 1 decimal place or\nthe phrase “Heat Index #.# NOT VALID!” with #.# as the calculated value."
