  "Body": "Chongan is an elementary school teacher. He is organizing his classroom crayons.\n\nIt is the end of the school year and, of course, he is exhausted. This is usually not his favorite task, so he decided to make it into\na fun learning experience for his first-graders. He will incorporate a lesson that involves color names, counting, typing on a\nkeyboard, and learning about the concept of \"most.\"\n\nAll of the crayons are either primary colors (RED, BLUE, YELLOW) or secondary colors (ORANGE, GREEN, PURPLE). The\nkids will type in the name of each color and then type in the number of crayons in their bucket that are that color. The program\nwill print out the color with the most crayons.\n\nYou are writing this program for Chongan to be sure, but really, it is for the kids.",
  "Input": "The first line will contain an integer, n, denoting the number of test cases in the data. The number of test cases will be in\nthe range of [5,25]. Each line of data will consist of six pairs of colors and numbers with items separated by one space. The\ncolors will be one of these upper-case words (ORANGE, GREEN, PURPLE, BLUE, RED, YELLOW). Each color will be\nfollowed by an integer in the range [0,100] (ORANGE 41 means there are 41 orange crayons). The colors will be in random\norder, but all six colors will appear once on each line of data. There will be no ties in determining the winner.",
  "Output": "For each test case, output one of the six colors indicating which crayon was more numerous. Make sure there are no\nextra trailing spaces in your lines of output."
