  "Body": "Gabriel is fascinated by boxes. He seems to do everything using some kind of box-like pattern. This is the way his mind likes to\n\"store\" information. Gabriel has always studied for tests using this method. It allows him to learn information in a very unique\nway.\n\nGabriel needs you to write a program that will create boxes for written text that is provided. He will provide you with the size of\nthe box (we will call it N) and the text message (uppercase letters and spaces).\n\nYou shall first, remove any spaces from the message. Next you will organize the boxes using N.\n\nThe letters will be organized in N rows and N columns of character strings, each string N-letters wide.\n\nFor example, if N=5, you will create a 5x5 chart of strings, each string consisting of 5 letters. Letters will be used one-by-one\nmoving across the string in a row-major order method. It is possible that there are more than enough letters to fill in the box. If\nso, the remaining letters will not be used.\n\nIt is also possible that there are too few letters to fill in the chart. If so, print the message \"NOT ENOUGH LETTERS\"\n\nLook closely at the 5 examples below.",
  "Input": "The first line will contain an integer, T, denoting the number of test cases in the data. The number of test cases will be in\nthe range of [5,25]. Each line of data will consist of an integer in the range [1,10], then a space, then a string of characters and\nspaces. The string will have a length in the range [1,400].",
  "Output": "For each test case, each box of output should include N lines of N-letter strings separated by one space. If there are not\nenough letters, then \"NOT ENOUGH LETTERS\" will be displayed. Make sure there are no extra trailing spaces in your lines of\noutput."
