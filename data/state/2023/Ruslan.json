  "Body": "Your Algebra teacher has made a new seating chart! Now your only friend in the class, Ruslan, is on the other side of the class.\nYou will have to use your knowledge of high school social structures to send a message across the classroom to Ruslan.",
  "Input": "The first line will contain a variable n, denoting the number of data sets to follow. Each data set will consist of an\nunknown number of entries, each on their own line, succeeded by a line of 5 ‘=’ characters, like “=====”. Each entry in the data\nset will consist of two strings, each representing a name of a student, signifying their connection, or your ability to get a note\npassed from student to student. For example, if the entry was as follows: “Daniel Johnny”, we know that we can pass\nmessage from Johnny to Daniel, and vice versa . The name “Ruslan”, signifying your friend Ruslan, will be present at least\nonce in each data set, as will the name “You”, signifying you.",
  "Output": "The output for each test case should be the number of unique ways to get a message from you to Ruslan. None of the\npaths should ever visit a student more than once, as this will arouse suspicion from the teacher. You will output the number of\ndistinct paths from you to Ruslan as an integer, on its own line, as shown in the sample output."
