  "Body": "You could call Ace the \"Historian of UIL Academics.\" He has seen it all. He did Number Sense and Slide Rule in high school.\nHe has coached nearly every event. He, to this day, follows the competition by poring through the scores posted for the District,\nRegional, and State Meets.\n\nIf you walk by his house on a Friday afternoon and sit on the porch with him and have some iced tea, he will tell you some\nstories about the rich history of UIL Academics.\n\nJust the other day, he was telling me about the UIL Computer Science contest. It first came onto the scene in 1990 with a format\njust a bit different that the format it follows today. When I saw him, he was remembering the 1999 contest. Of course, this year\nmarks the 25th anniversary of that event. That was way back before there was a 6A classification.\n\nHe recalls that the 5A champion, Langham Creek, almost missed the Saturday programming portion of the contest. They were\ndropped off at Painter Hall which had been the site of the Friday night written test. But, programming in 1999 was held in the\nbrand new UIL Building on Manor Road. The team had to hike over a mile uphill with PCs and printers in tow and made it with\nonly minutes to spare. Ah, those were the days.\n\nLet's print out a list of the 1999 UIL CompSci Champions for Ace.",
  "Input": "None.",
  "Output": "Print the information below that lists the 1999 UIL State CompSci Champions. You will notice there are 6 dashes\n(minus signs) in the output."
