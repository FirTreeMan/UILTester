  "Body": "Dilbert likes to play around with numbers and has developed an interesting process for manipulating positive integers. He wants\nto reverse integers and 12345 reversed in decimal form is 54321 which is just too simple. However, the binary form might be\nmore interesting. The binary form of 12345 is <b>0011 0000 0011 1001</b> (separated into 4-bit groups for readability) and the reverse\nof the binary form would be <b>1001 1100 0000 1100</b> which has a decimal value of 38848, not 54321! But to make it even more\ninteresting, lets discard leading 0s of the initial binary form before it is reversed. So, the modified binary form now becomes <b>11\n0000 0011 1001</b> and when reversed produces <b>10 0111 0000 0011</b> which has a decimal value of 9987. Hmmmâ€¦\n\nCan help Dilbert by writing program to verify his results?",
  "Input": "An unknown number of whitespace separated positive integers but no more than 100. Each integer is a single test case\nand will consist of a single positive integer that will not exceed the value 9 x 10<sup>18</sup>\n.",
  "Output": "Each test case will produce 1 line of output containing the decimal equivalent of the reversed binary form followed by\na single space and the reversed full binary form without leading 0s"
