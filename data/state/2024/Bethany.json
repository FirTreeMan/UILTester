  "Body": "Bethany loves numbers. She is a Number Sense expert. As part of her study, she has memorized the number of factors that each\ninteger from 1 to 100 has. She has also learned various techniques for quickly determining the number of factors for any number.\n\nShe wants to see what is in common for integers that have the same number of factors\n\nWrite a program that inputs two numbers, N and F. Print the first N integers which have exactly F factors.\n\nExample: If the inputs were 5 and 4, she would want to see the first 5 integers which all have 4 factors. Those numbers would be\n6, 8, 10, 14, and 15.",
  "Input": "The first line of data will be an integer T in the range [1,20]. T represents the number of data lines to follow. Each line of\ndata will contain two integers N and F. N is an integer in the range [2,20] indicating how many outputs should be created for that\ndata set. F is an integer in the range [2,100]. F represents the factor count for each output for that data set. One space shall\nseparate N and F.",
  "Output": "Each test case will produce 1 line of output containing at least 2, but not more than 20 positive integers. Each line will\nprint the first N positive integers which have exactly F factors. There will be one space between each number in each line of\noutputs."
